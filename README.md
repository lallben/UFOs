# UFOs
## Project Overview & Objective:
This project is for Dana, a data journalist who wants to write about a topic that is close to the inhabitants of her home town. She would like to build a webpage and a  dynamic table that would display the data for UFO sightings from a database. Dana wanted to  provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, she would like them to be able to filter the data by city, state, country, and shape.

## Tools used:
- Data source: UFO data (a database of UFO sightings across the US)
- Coding language: Javascript, HTML/CSS
- Software/Applications: Visual Studio, GitHub

## End Result:
The coding has been finished and the webpage can be viewed [at this link](https://lallben.github.io/UFOs/)<br>
